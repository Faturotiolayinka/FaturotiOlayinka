## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Faturoti Olayinka
Hello! Iâ€™m Olayinka, a data-loving Computer Science graduate whoâ€™s always curious about how numbers tell stories (yes, even the messy ones in spreadsheets!). Over the past year, Iâ€™ve gotten my hands dirty (in the best way) with Python, Power BI, Excel, and SQL: cleaning data, building models, creating dashboards, and making sense of all the chaos that comes with raw information.

Whether itâ€™s predicting Titanic survivors, analyzing movie ratings, or helping others understand data from scratch, I enjoy every bit of it. Iâ€™ve trained everyone from fellow NYSC corps members to PhD holders on tools like Excel and Power BI, because I believe that knowledge is best when shared.

When Iâ€™m not in front of my laptop decoding datasets, Iâ€™m either helping someone debug theirs or teaching analytics in a way that makes sense.

Letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re into data, learning, collaboration, or just want to geek out over a Power BI dashboard!
